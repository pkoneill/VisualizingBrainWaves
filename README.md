# Visualizing Brain Waves Workshop

**Objectives**: To introduce the concept of brain waves and the methods for using home-made electroencephalography devices (EEGs). During this two day course, we will use Day 1 to learn the history, math, and scientific background needed for understanding electroencephalography, and then on Day 2, we will record our heart and brain activity and try to control a light switch using our brain waves. 

In Part I: Brain Waves, we discuss the history of the EEG as well as the theory of how coordinated electrical activity of billions of neurons produces brain waves of different frequencies. During the interactive section, we will enter a virtual neurophysiology lab to familiarize ourselves with neural activity and the different frequences of brain waves commonly recorded using an EEG. 

In Part II: EEG data analysis, we will become familiar with the basic electrical components of an EEG circuit which collects, filters, and amplifies signals from the brain so that the patterns in these signals can be analyzed. In the interactive segments of Part II, students will use Python to understand the mathematics and coding that go into reading brain waves into the computer.
